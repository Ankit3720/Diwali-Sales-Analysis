üîç Personal Project: Diwali Sales Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset on Diwali sales using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective was to derive meaningful insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and popular product categories during the Diwali season.

Key Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data to make it analysis-ready.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends such as peak sales periods, high-demand products, and customer demographics.
Visualized insights using bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to present findings in an easy-to-understand manner.
Utilized statistical methods to analyze and predict sales patterns.
Skills & Tools Used:

Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Data cleaning, EDA, data visualization, trend analysis
This project gave me deeper insight into how data analytics can help businesses optimize their strategies during peak sales periods like Diwali.
